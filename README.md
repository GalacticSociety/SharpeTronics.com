# Summary
This web application is the core website for SharpeTronics.com. It is a live JAMstack (Jekyll, API's, Markup) example of the power of static websites with micro services that includes all the bells and whistles for comments, newsletter subscriptions, content management systems (CMS), site generators, blog posts, continuous delivery (CD), version management, ecommerce shopping, progressive web applications (PWA), and many more.

Javascript frameworks create more complexity than needed, this example displays minimal need for Javascript; therefore increasing security, reducing file size and complex work environments, increasing load times and reducing the learning curve for web developers, while keeping all the fun and speedy reactivity of the modern web architecture. We enable more focus on design and content; while enabling increased portability, automated testing, speed and security.

No proprietary operating system dependencies required, only Docker Engine super machines and some tender love and care.
