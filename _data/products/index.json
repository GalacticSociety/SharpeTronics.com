By default the configurations are located at: /etc/nginx/ & /etc/nginx/sites-available/. To keep things tidy and organized, we create a new api.example.org conf for each domain we are publicly facing to WWW. \n\n### Make Directory & Copy Default HTML page \n\n```sudo mkdir -p /var/www/api.example.org/html/```\n\n```sudo cp -R /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html /var/www/api.example.org/html/index.html```\n\n### Duplicate Default Config \n\n```sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/api.example.org```\n\n### Update NGINX api.example.org Config File\n\nThe **Proxy Config** is important and allows the Strapi 4.0 server to run with nginx. In general, the rest allows SSL and redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, plus denies automated user-agents like wget.\n```\nserver {\n        # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS\n        listen 80;\n        server_name _;\n        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n\n        # Deny Automated User-Agents\n        if ($http_user_agent ~* (netcrawl|npbot|malicious|LWP::Simple|BBBike|wget)) {\n        return 403;\n        }\n}\n\nserver {\n    # Listen HTTPS\n    listen 443 ssl http2; # managed by Certbot\n    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;\n    server_name api.example.org www.api.example.org;\n\n    # sites document root\n    root /var/www/api.example.org/html;\n    index index.html index.htm;\n\n    # SSL Config\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.example.org/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.example.org/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot\n    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot\n    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot\n\n    # Proxy Config\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://strapi;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection \"Upgrade\";\n        proxy_pass_request_headers on;\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n``` CTRL+X, then Y for Yes to save```\n\n### Symbolic Link to sites-enabled\nThis creates a 'mirror' like reference to the sites-available folder. \n\n```sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/api.exampleorg /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/```\n\n#### Verify Symbolic Link \n```ls /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/```\n\n## DNS Configuration\nWe now point our domain to the server we are hosting our Strapi on. i.e. 123.123.1.1\n\n### Update DNS Settings\nDepending on your DNS provider or maybe you have your own Domain Name Server, we point our DNS settings for example.org to 123.123.1.1 as type A. I personally recommend Cloudflare.\n\n## Create SSL Certs\nWe run the automated tool Certbot and create all the needed files and update our *api.example.org* configuration file. \n\n### Run Certbot\n```sudo  certbot --nginx```\n\n```Choose api.example.org for the site to create certs. for.```\n\n```Choose option 1 to disable auto redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS since we already redirected the traffic manually.```\n\n**Note** sudo certbot renew --dry-run will test for automatic renewal for your certs. [Certbot Insturctions]\n\n### Verify api.example.org Updated with Correct Domain\n\n```sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/api.example.org```\n\n### Test Config & Restart Nginx\n\n```sudo nginx -t```\n\n```sudo systemctl restart nginx```\n\n## Firewall Configuration\nAllow public to connect via HTTPS, we need to open up ports 80 & 443 (HTTP & HTTPS).\n\n### Allow UFW Ports for Public Traffic\n```sudo ufw allow HTTPS```\n\n```sudo ufw allow HTTP```\n\n### Verify Status & Reload UFW\n```sudo ufw status```\n\n```sudo ufw reload```\n\n**Tip** sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full' opens both port 80 & 443 (For SSL / TLS encryption).\n\n## Getting Started with Strapi\nNow, we must install Strapi 4.0 on the server and launch the Strapi server.\n\n### Strapi Default Installation\nGoto desired place to install Strapi project i.e. ~/development/my-strapi-project, then,\n\n```yarn create strapi-app my-project```\n\n**Note:** The default Strapi installation uses SQLite as the database. You are able to use other databases like PostgreSQL. See **[Strapi Installation]** for more details.\n\n### Launch Strapi Development Server\n\n```yarn develop```\n\n### Launch Strapi from Domain URL \n\n```Goto: api.example.com via web browser of your choice.```\n\n```Follow the instructions and continue creating a new Strapi administrator.```\n\n#### References:\n[Nginx Strapi Configuration](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/deployment/optional-software/nginx-proxy.html#nginx-upstream)\n\n[Strapi Installation](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/cli.html#creating-a-strapi-project)\n\n[Nginx Server Blocks](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-nginx-server-blocks-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-16-04)\n\n[Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)\n\n[Certbot Insturctions](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=ubuntufocal)\n\n#### Donations Are Welcome\n[Cash App](https://cash.app/$sharpeee)","createdAt":"2022-05-24T19:03:47.148Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-11T22:07:37.794Z","publishedAt":"2022-05-24T19:03:48.499Z","locale":"en","layout":"post","slug":"setup-a-secure-nginx-https-web-server-with-let-s-encrypt-strapi-4-0-headless-cms","banner_image_description":"Two feet wearing socks beside each other with faces of Santa Clause and another of Rudolph"}},{"id":14,"attributes":{"title":"Update your Strapi CMS with your own Favicon","subheading":"How-to replace the favicon","content":"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, we will be replacing the Strapi favicon with your own favicon.

In general, the rest allows SSL and redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, plus denies automated user-agents like wget.\n```\nserver {\n        # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS\n        listen 80;\n        server_name _;\n        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n\n        # Deny Automated User-Agents\n        if ($http_user_agent ~* (netcrawl|npbot|malicious|LWP::Simple|BBBike|wget)) {\n        return 403;\n        }\n}\n\nserver {\n    # Listen HTTPS\n    listen 443 ssl http2; # managed by Certbot\n    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;\n    server_name api.example.org www.api.example.org;\n\n    # sites document root\n    root /var/www/api.example.org/html;\n    index index.html index.htm;\n\n    # SSL Config\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.example.org/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.example.org/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot\n    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot\n    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot\n\n    # Proxy Config\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://strapi;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection \"Upgrade\";\n        proxy_pass_request_headers on;\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n``` CTRL+X, then Y for Yes to save```\n\n### Symbolic Link to sites-enabled\nThis creates a 'mirror' like reference to the sites-available folder. \n\n```sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/api.exampleorg /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/```\n\n#### Verify Symbolic Link \n```ls /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/```\n\n## DNS Configuration\nWe now point our domain to the server we are hosting our Strapi on. i.e. 123.123.1.1\n\n### Update DNS Settings\nDepending on your DNS provider or maybe you have your own Domain Name Server, we point our DNS settings for example.org to 123.123.1.1 as type A. I personally recommend Cloudflare.\n\n## Create SSL Certs\nWe run the automated tool Certbot and create all the needed files and update our *api.example.org* configuration file. \n\n### Run Certbot\n```sudo  certbot --nginx```\n\n```Choose api.example.org for the site to create certs. for.```\n\n```Choose option 1 to disable auto redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS since we already redirected the traffic manually.```\n\n**Note** sudo certbot renew --dry-run will test for automatic renewal for your certs. [Certbot Insturctions]\n\n### Verify api.example.org Updated with Correct Domain\n\n```sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/api.example.org```\n\n### Test Config & Restart Nginx\n\n```sudo nginx -t```\n\n```sudo systemctl restart nginx```\n\n## Firewall Configuration\nAllow public to connect via HTTPS, we need to open up ports 80 & 443 (HTTP & HTTPS).\n\n### Allow UFW Ports for Public Traffic\n```sudo ufw allow HTTPS```\n\n```sudo ufw allow HTTP```\n\n### Verify Status & Reload UFW\n```sudo ufw status```\n\n```sudo ufw reload```\n\n**Tip** sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full' opens both port 80 & 443 (For SSL / TLS encryption).\n\n## Getting Started with Strapi\nNow, we must install Strapi 4.0 on the server and launch the Strapi server.\n\n### Strapi Default Installation\nGoto desired place to install Strapi project i.e. ~/development/my-strapi-project, then,\n\n```yarn create strapi-app my-project```\n\n**Note:** The default Strapi installation uses SQLite as the database. You are able to use other databases like PostgreSQL. See **[Strapi Installation]** for more details.\n\n### Launch Strapi Development Server\n\n```yarn develop```\n\n### Launch Strapi from Domain URL \n\n```Goto: api.example.com via web browser of your choice.```\n\n```Follow the instructions and continue creating a new Strapi administrator.```\n\n#### References:\n[Nginx Strapi Configuration](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/deployment/optional-software/nginx-proxy.html#nginx-upstream)\n\n[Strapi Installation](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/cli.html#creating-a-strapi-project)\n\n[Nginx Server Blocks](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-nginx-server-blocks-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-16-04)\n\n[Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)\n\n[Certbot Insturctions](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=ubuntufocal)\n\n#### Donations Are Welcome\n[Cash App](https://cash.app/$sharpeee)","createdAt":"2022-05-24T19:03:47.148Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-11T22:07:37.794Z","publishedAt":"2022-05-24T19:03:48.499Z","locale":"en","layout":"post","slug":"setup-a-secure-nginx-https-web-server-with-let-s-encrypt-strapi-4-0-headless-cms","banner_image_description":"Two feet wearing socks beside each other with faces of Santa Clause and another of Rudolph"}},{"id":14,"attributes":{"title":"Update your Strapi CMS with your own Favicon","subheading":"How-to replace the favicon","content":"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, we will be replacing the Strapi favicon with your own favicon.

Going through any graphical user interface (GUI) to run critical services for your company is like playing the telephone game. Securing our environment begins at the terminal & from terminal experience we create a deeper learning experience for ourselves and build confidence along the way.\n\nThis article will extrapolate on initializing a Ubuntu Linux VPS for the first time and how we secure our environment through the terminal. No Windows or MacOS pancakes here; only Linux.\n\nWhen beginning a new server or garden, the soil is most important; we create an environment to protect and maximize growth potential. The VPS provider may give you an OS they installed, but I always create a fresh install myself.\n\n### Logging in via SSH\n\n##### Creating RSA Public Key\nBefore you are able to login with SSH, you will most likely have to generate and add a RSA public key.\n\n`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`\n\n##### Copy / Paste Public Key\nAfter key is generated, we display the public key and add it to VPS account. *Optionally, you may have to add the key with ssh-copy-id user@ip_address.*\n\n`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`\n\n```\nssh-rsa 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 user@hostname\n```\n\n##### SSH into VPS\nNext, we login to our VPS and specify -i what key to use. The -i is only needed if you have more than one key. The -v displays verbose or details of what the command is doing in the terminal.\n\n`ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@123.123.123.123`\n\nSuccess! Now, we are able to update and upgrade our packages.\n\n### Prepping Linux Environment\n\n##### Update Sources & Packages\n`apt-get update && apt-get upgrade`\n\n##### Disable Ubuntu Sudo Timeout\nIn Ubuntu, sudo has a timeout built in for ease of use. I personally remove this timeout; without knowing you are using sudo will create all kinds of headaches in the future. When you make use of root privileges, we must explicitly type sudo each command.\n\n`sudo visudo`\n\nadd `Defaults        env_reset, timestamp_timeout=00`\n\n### Setting Up The Firewall\nAfter we have logged in via SSH for root user account. I recommend installing a powerful firewall called: **ufw**\n\n`apt-get install ufw`\n\n`ufw status`\n\n`ufw allow ssh`\n\nDisplay the status of the firewall and determine if ssh has been allowed. If nomenclature *ssh* doesn't add the ports, we do this manually with ufw allow 22/udp & ufw all 22/tcp. Port 22 is the common port SSH server makes use of; we are able to change this port for extra hardening, but for the sake of this tutorial, we will use port 22.\n`ufw status`\n\n```\nTo                         Action      From\n--                         ------      ----\n22/tcp                     ALLOW        Anywhere                  \n22/udp                     ALLOW        Anywhere\n```\n\nNow, we enable the firewall **after** we allow port 22. The SSH connection should remain open. If it closes, SSH back into your VPS.\n`ufw enable`\n\n##### Check If Port Is Open\nOnce telnet is ran, ssh information should populate\n`telnet 123.123.123.123 22`\n\n```\nTrying 123.123.123.123...\nConnected to 123.123.123.123.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nSSH-X.0-OpenSSH_X.2p1 Ubuntu-Xubuntu0.2\n\nInvalid SSH identification string.\nConnection closed by foreign host.\n```\n\n### Creating New Users & Permissions\n\nTo further expand on the garden, we must define a secure space for each plant or service we are running. To manage each service, like dns, mail, gitea, etc... we create a new user for each of these environments. This separation is important for operational security (OPSEC).\n\n`adduser username` *Note: If we want to use Dockerfile or auto script without prompts, we make use of the **useradd** command.*\n\n```\nAdding user `username' ...\nAdding new group `username' (1003) ...\nAdding new user `username' (1002) with group `username' ...\nCreating home directory `/home/username' ...\nCopying files from `/etc/skel' ...\nNew password: \n```\n\nNext, if the user should have sudo permission, we do the following.\n\n`usermod -a -G sudo username`\n\n##### Prove User was Created\n\n`cat /etc/passwd`\n\n```\n...\nusername:x:1001:1002:User Name,,,:/home/username:/bin/bash\n...\n```\n\n##### Logging In with New Username\n\n`su username`\n\n##### Update SSH Config\n`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`\n\nAdd sudo to the **AllowGroups** like so:\n\n`AllowGroups wheel root sudo`\n\nNext, we disable root login since we will only have root privileges when using sudo.\n\n`PermitRootLogin no`\n\n##### SSH Directory Creation For New Username\nCreating new user access to SSH login.\nWhen you connect to new username@ip, the vps user needs the public key for verification of authorized user. Authorized users with correct **private key** will be able to login to vps via ssh protocol.\n\n`mkdir ~/.ssh`\n\n`nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`\n\nPaste your public key we created earlier into the authorized_keys file.\n\n##### Update file & folder permissions\n\n`chmod 700 ~/.ssh`\n\n`chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`\n\n##### Restart SSH service\n\n`sudo service ssh restart`\n\n`exit`\n\nIn conclusion, we are now able to login via SSH with new user and have also disabled root user logins.\nThis process will have to be done for each user that is created.\n\n### Backups with Rsync Superpowers!\n\nAfter all our hard work and focus, we should backup our VPS and create scheduled routines. Depending on your use case, I would recommend at least weekly backups.\n\nThe following command is quite complex, but, essentially we are discarding folders we don't need, backing up the entire VPS to our local machine and preserving all permissions and file integrity from the VPS.\n\n- rsync - A fast, versatile, local and remote file-copying utility\n- -aAXv - The files are transferred in \"archive\" mode, which ensures that symbolic links, devices, permissions, ownerships, modification times, ACLs, and extended attributes are preserved.\n- / - Source directory\n- --exclude - Excludes the given directories from backup.\n\n```\nsudo rsync -aAXv --rsh=\"ssh -i /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa\" --recursive --progress --exclude={\"/dev/*\",\"/proc/*\",\"/sys/*\",\"/tmp/*\",\"/run/*\",\"/mnt/*\",\"/media/*\",\"/lost+found\",\"/backups/*\"} user@123.123.123.123:/ /home/user/VPS/Backups/\n```\n\n#### Sources:\n* Full System Backup Using Rsync - <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rsync#Full_system_backup>\n","createdAt":"2022-05-24T18:46:21.906Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-11T22:10:34.668Z","publishedAt":"2022-05-24T18:46:31.369Z","locale":"en","layout":"post","slug":"linux-vps-hardening","banner_image_description":"The back of a black hoodie hacking at software"}},{"id":7,"attributes":{"title":"Setup a Secure NGINX HTTPS Web Server with Let's Encrypt + Strapi 4.0 Headless CMS","subheading":"Static Websites with CMS","content":"## General\nFor this tutorial, we will launch a secure SSL NGINX web server for your website domain example.org and enable an API to be consumed from the subdomain i.e. api.example.org with Strapi 4.0. \n\n*Tip:* For each reference, I add the **[reference name]** in brackets at the end of the \"transmission.\" **[AWK example]**\n \n## Requirements: \n- a Ubuntu Linux 20.04 VPS with SSH access\n- CLI knowledge\n- a registered web domain i.e. example.org\n- Basic knowledge of DNS and managing a VPS with SSH \n\n## Dependencies & Packages\n- NodeJS v12 or v14 (v14 is recommended for Strapi 4.0)\n- Npm v6+ & Yarn (Yarn is optional)\n- Certbot with Let's Encrypt\n- Nano editor\n\n## Prepare Operating System \nLet's Begin!

By default the configurations are located at: /etc/nginx/ & /etc/nginx/sites-available/. To keep things tidy and organized, we create a new api.example.org conf for each domain we are publicly facing to WWW. \n\n### Make Directory & Copy Default HTML page \n\n```sudo mkdir -p /var/www/api.example.org/html/```\n\n```sudo cp -R /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html /var/www/api.example.org/html/index.html```\n\n### Duplicate Default Config \n\n```sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/api.example.org```\n\n### Update NGINX api.example.org Config File\n\nThe **Proxy Config** is important and allows the Strapi 4.0 server to run with nginx. In general, the rest allows SSL and redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, plus denies automated user-agents like wget.\n```\nserver {\n        # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS\n        listen 80;\n        server_name _;\n        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n\n        # Deny Automated User-Agents\n        if ($http_user_agent ~* (netcrawl|npbot|malicious|LWP::Simple|BBBike|wget)) {\n        return 403;\n        }\n}\n\nserver {\n    # Listen HTTPS\n    listen 443 ssl http2; # managed by Certbot\n    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;\n    server_name api.example.org www.api.example.org;\n\n    # sites document root\n    root /var/www/api.example.org/html;\n    index index.html index.htm;\n\n    # SSL Config\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.example.org/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.example.org/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot\n    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot\n    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot\n\n    # Proxy Config\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://strapi;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection \"Upgrade\";\n        proxy_pass_request_headers on;\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n``` CTRL+X, then Y for Yes to save```\n\n### Symbolic Link to sites-enabled\nThis creates a 'mirror' like reference to the sites-available folder. \n\n```sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/api.exampleorg /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/```\n\n#### Verify Symbolic Link \n```ls /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/```\n\n## DNS Configuration\nWe now point our domain to the server we are hosting our Strapi on. i.e. 123.123.1.1\n\n### Update DNS Settings\nDepending on your DNS provider or maybe you have your own Domain Name Server, we point our DNS settings for example.org to 123.123.1.1 as type A. I personally recommend Cloudflare.\n\n## Create SSL Certs\nWe run the automated tool Certbot and create all the needed files and update our *api.example.org* configuration file. \n\n### Run Certbot\n```sudo  certbot --nginx```\n\n```Choose api.example.org for the site to create certs. for.```\n\n```Choose option 1 to disable auto redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS since we already redirected the traffic manually.```\n\n**Note** sudo certbot renew --dry-run will test for automatic renewal for your certs.

Keep in mind, if you are reading this from the future, the versions will change.\n\n### Update System\n\n```sudo apt update```\n\n### Install Nginx Certbot Packages\n\n```sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx```\n\n### Install NGINX & verify version \n\n```sudo apt install nginx```\n\n```node -v && nginx -v```\n\n**Tip:** Strapi recommends nodejs v14, but v12 works.\n\n### Install Yarn (Corepack) \n```npm i -g corepack``` **[Install Yarn]**\n\n## Configure NGINX \nNext, we will configure your newly installed Nginx server. By default the configurations are located at: /etc/nginx/ & /etc/nginx/sites-available/. To keep things tidy and organized, we create a new api.example.org conf for each domain we are publicly facing to WWW. \n\n### Make Directory & Copy Default HTML page \n\n```sudo mkdir -p /var/www/api.example.org/html/```\n\n```sudo cp -R /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html /var/www/api.example.org/html/index.html```\n\n### Duplicate Default Config \n\n```sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/api.example.org```\n\n### Update NGINX api.example.org Config File\n\nThe **Proxy Config** is important and allows the Strapi 4.0 server to run with nginx. In general, the rest allows SSL and redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, plus denies automated user-agents like wget.\n```\nserver {\n        # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS\n        listen 80;\n        server_name _;\n        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n\n        # Deny Automated User-Agents\n        if ($http_user_agent ~* (netcrawl|npbot|malicious|LWP::Simple|BBBike|wget)) {\n        return 403;\n        }\n}\n\nserver {\n    # Listen HTTPS\n    listen 443 ssl http2; # managed by Certbot\n    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;\n    server_name api.example.org www.api.example.org;\n\n    # sites document root\n    root /var/www/api.example.org/html;\n    index index.html index.htm;\n\n    # SSL Config\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.example.org/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.example.org/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot\n    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot\n    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot\n\n    # Proxy Config\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://strapi;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection \"Upgrade\";\n        proxy_pass_request_headers on;\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n``` CTRL+X, then Y for Yes to save```\n\n### Symbolic Link to sites-enabled\nThis creates a 'mirror' like reference to the sites-available folder. \n\n```sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/api.exampleorg /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/```\n\n#### Verify Symbolic Link \n```ls /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/```\n\n## DNS Configuration\nWe now point our domain to the server we are hosting our Strapi on. i.e. 123.123.1.1\n\n### Update DNS Settings\nDepending on your DNS provider or maybe you have your own Domain Name Server, we point our DNS settings for example.org to 123.123.1.1 as type A. I personally recommend Cloudflare.\n\n## Create SSL Certs\nWe run the automated tool Certbot and create all the needed files and update our *api.example.org* configuration file. \n\n### Run Certbot\n```sudo  certbot --nginx```\n\n```Choose api.example.org for the site to create certs. for.```\n\n```Choose option 1 to disable auto redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS since we already redirected the traffic manually.```\n\n**Note** sudo certbot renew --dry-run will test for automatic renewal for your certs. [Certbot Insturctions]\n\n### Verify api.example.org Updated with Correct Domain\n\n```sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/api.example.org```\n\n### Test Config & Restart Nginx\n\n```sudo nginx -t```\n\n```sudo systemctl restart nginx```\n\n## Firewall Configuration\nAllow public to connect via HTTPS, we need to open up ports 80 & 443 (HTTP & HTTPS).\n\n### Allow UFW Ports for Public Traffic\n```sudo ufw allow HTTPS```\n\n```sudo ufw allow HTTP```\n\n### Verify Status & Reload UFW\n```sudo ufw status```\n\n```sudo ufw reload```\n\n**Tip** sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full' opens both port 80 & 443 (For SSL / TLS encryption).\n\n## Getting Started with Strapi\nNow, we must install Strapi 4.0 on the server and launch the Strapi server.\n\n### Strapi Default Installation\nGoto desired place to install Strapi project i.e. ~/development/my-strapi-project, then,\n\n```yarn create strapi-app my-project```\n\n**Note:** The default Strapi installation uses SQLite as the database. You are able to use other databases like PostgreSQL. See **[Strapi Installation]** for more details.\n\n### Launch Strapi Development Server\n\n```yarn develop```\n\n### Launch Strapi from Domain URL \n\n```Goto: api.example.com via web browser of your choice.```\n\n```Follow the instructions and continue creating a new Strapi administrator.```\n\n#### References:\n[Nginx Strapi Configuration](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/deployment/optional-software/nginx-proxy.html#nginx-upstream)\n\n[Strapi Installation](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/cli.html#creating-a-strapi-project)\n\n[Nginx Server Blocks](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-nginx-server-blocks-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-16-04)\n\n[Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)\n\n[Certbot Insturctions](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=ubuntufocal)\n\n#### Donations Are Welcome\n[Cash App](https://cash.app/$sharpeee)","createdAt":"2022-05-24T19:03:47.148Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-11T22:07:37.794Z","publishedAt":"2022-05-24T19:03:48.499Z","locale":"en","layout":"post","slug":"setup-a-secure-nginx-https-web-server-with-let-s-encrypt-strapi-4-0-headless-cms","banner_image_description":"Two feet wearing socks beside each other with faces of Santa Clause and another of Rudolph"}}]},"product":{"data":{"id":11,"attributes":{"createdAt":"2022-11-15T01:31:56.488Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T04:20:51.727Z","publishedAt":"2022-11-15T01:31:58.292Z","quantity":3,"description":"A place to describe the product to your readers.
